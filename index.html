  <div class = "content-section">One of the standout features of this summer's tournament are the distances involved, with the competition taking place across three massive countries. For all the criticisms of the 2022 World Cup, it was staged in an area the size of Delaware: 2026 will be one of the most geographically diverse tournaments ever. 
    <br><br>This has created a logistical headache for coaches and staff, who will have to deal with frequent flights and rapidly changing plans. England manager Thomas Tuchel has <a href = "https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/articles/cx2dxqzxy2ro">already been complaining</a> about the impact of travel on his squad, particularly between areas with different climates. Players will be playing an extra game this tournament, and more travel could mean more fatigue and injuries.
    <br><br>This also ramps up the cost for fans: on top of <a href = "https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6870859/2025/12/08/world-cup-2026-tickets-resale-price/">eye-watering ticket prices</a>, just getting around North America is going to be incredibly costly, especially with last-minute spikes in demand.
  </div>

  <div class="content-section content-with-image">
        <div class="side-text">
        And finally, there is the environmental impact of all this moving about, especially apparent in a continent feeling the effects of climate change. By some calculations, <a href="https://carboncopy.info/dangerous-heat-escalating-drought-in-north-america-a-threat-for-2026-fifa-world-cup-report/">10 out of 16</a> of the stadiums are in areas at risk of dangerously high temperatures, and states such as California and Florida regularly suffer from extreme weather events. One venue for this World Cup, Los Angeles' SoFi stadium, is less than 25 kilometres from the site of January’s devastating wildfires.

There are obvious advantages to travelling as little as possible this tournament. But who has the longest route to New York?

        <p>The tournament’s expansion to 48 teams – and FIFA’s complex way of placing third place finishers in the group stage – means there are a massive number of combinations of venues a team could play at on the way to the final.<br><br>In total there are <b>256</b> different paths.</p>

        <p>Winning Group A would give England their shortest possible path. <br><br>They would still face a journey of more than 10,000km, with games in Mexico City and Miami, which will be sweltering in July.</p>

        <p>Finishing third in their group, the Three Lions would have to complete a round trip to Vancouver from Kansas City early in the knockouts – an 8 hour round trip.<br><br>Should they fly every leg, an England die-hard would produce around <b>1,800kg</b> of CO2 following the team.</p>
